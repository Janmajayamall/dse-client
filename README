## Spec for Prototype

1. Develop a file exchange system where leechers pay per byte to seeder (seeders are providers).

## Points to consider

1. Clients that avail services don't need to store account tree. They just need to store their receipts
   and their current balance.
   It will be nice to have that such clients can watch for invalid updates. It's not necessary since we
   are expecting watch towers.
2. Provider clients must store the entire account tree for two reasons - (i) They are providing services
   so their intereaction has more variety and frequency. (ii) Since they are service providers, they can afford
   to store the entire account tree.
